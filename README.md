# ZUM
Project for Advanced Machine Learning course at EITI-WUT

The main goal for this project was to implement library in R for time series data vectorization. In the research part, we checked the impact of the time window size and the applied aggregating functions on the model accuracy.

Used dataset:
1) WESAD (Werable Stress and Affect Detection) - Multi-class Classification
2) Bar Crawl: Detecting Heavy Drinking - Binary Classification
3) Energy Prediction - Regression

library for Vectorization - tsvectorization

Functions for features importance in file features.R
Preprocessing-vectorization in files: drinking-prerocessing.R , energy_preprocessing.R , stres_preprocessing.R
Models calculation in files: heavy_drink.R, energy.R, stress.R
