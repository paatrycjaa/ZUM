Description: This package delivers a method for processing a time series dataset. Signals in a form of time series often require additioanl processing in order tobe used with traditional classifying/regression tools. This package allows for applying standard aggregation functions such as mean, standard deviation etc. as well as user-defined functions for more control, e.g. for acquiring frequency data.
